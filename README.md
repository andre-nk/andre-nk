### About Me
I'm a first-year Computer Science student at Universitas Gadjah Mada while pursuing professional background as a part-time freelancer in Flutter Development. While expanding my experiences in other IT-related fields, such as Data Science, Web Development, and UI/UX Design, I always strive to deliver production-grade projects, well-documented workflow, and persistence. I enjoyed the whole process of development because of the satisfaction of creatively tackling challenges. Lastly, I'm always motivated by software's impact on many real problems and the fact that this is an opportunity to improve my soft skills and networking skills.
