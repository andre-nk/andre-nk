### About Me
I'm Andreas Notokusumo, a versatile software engineer and Computer Science student at Universitas Gadjah Mada in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. With over 4 years of diverse experience, I'm forever grateful for opportunities to delve into numerous facets of technology, from full-stack web development to mobile app development, project management, UI/UX design, cloud computing, and lately operating system (OS) development.
Throughout these years, the one true calling has always been software engineering. I'm intrigued by the intricacies of delivering production-grade apps, starting from the architectural design, leveraging discipline in the coding process, and also the human dynamics behind the project.
Above all that, I hold a profound respect for the fundamental concepts of Computer Science, which provide the necessary abstraction for innovation and problem-solving.
In essence, as a dedicated CS student, I actively seek out challenging opportunities to further expand my skills and knowledge. I am committed to refining my understanding of fundamental concepts while pushing the boundaries of what's possible in software development. So, let's connect and explore how we can innovate together.
